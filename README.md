                                            Abstract

Blackjack is a popular gambling game where the aim is to beat the dealer. Dif-
ferent strategies have been developed over time to maximize the profit. To be a
successful Blackjack player, one must master basic strategy, card counting and
betting strategies. Basic strategy guides players in how to play their cards. The
most common card counting is called High-Low. When the player has the ad-
vantage, he can start betting according to a betting strategy. There are different
betting strategies, such as the Kelly Criterion, betting with units in regard to
current bankroll, and betting with units in disregard to current bankroll. In
order to find the most profitable way of playing, 500 000 games of Blackjack
were simulated with an artificial intelligence. The results showed that count-
ing cards significantly increased the playerâ€™s advantage and proved to be more
profitable than playing with basic strategy with fixed bets. Betting according
to the Kelly Criterion gives the lowest house edge, while betting with units in
regard to current bankroll proved to be the most profitable strategy.
